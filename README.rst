LightLdapd README
=================

LightLdapd is a small and easy to manage LDAP server for small
home/classroom/school sized networks that can include thin clients. It
is designed to provide network wide users/groups/etc support to
supplement the excellent network dns/dhcp/tftp support provided by
dnsmasq.

It uses local PAM and NSS for authentication and to export the local
passwd/group/shadow/etc system databases. This means it has no special
separate ldap database to manage, and users/groups/etc can be managed
normally on the LightLdapd machine. No database setup or ldap
management tools are required, it just exports all the local
users/groups/etc. Client machines can then use libpam_ldapd and
libnss_ldapd to have all the same users/groups/etc as are on the
machine where LightLdapd is running.

The code is small, clean and efficient C, leveraging of existing
libraries as much as possible. It uses libev for an efficient event
loop. It uses asn1c to auto-generate the LDAP message
parsing/generating from the ASN.1 spec. It uses libpam for
authentication. It is small and efficient enough to run on a router or
NAS.

LightLdapd was forked from the excellent entente by Sergey Urbanovich
with his blessing. The choice to fork was made in order to leave
entente as simple as possible and avoid adding features needed for
LightLdapd. Improvements have and will be fed back into entente when
they don't increase its size.

The rest of this readme is not finished yet.
