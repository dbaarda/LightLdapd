lightldapd (1.0.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Forked LightLdapd project from entente.

    With permission and thanks to Sergey Urbanovich, the author of entente.

  * Changed name from entente to lightldapd.

    The forked project is now named LightLdapd, and the binary and cfgs have
    been renamed to lightldapd.

  * Changed license from MIT to GPLv3.

    This means we require contributions to come back rather than spawn private
    forks. I have confirmed with the entente author this is OK.

  * Improve project documentation:

    Add documentation based on templates in
    http://minkirri.apana.org.au/~abo/projects/prjdocs/.

  * Tidy code.

    Reformat again using a different preferred style without tabs. Change `make
    tidy` target to reformat using tidyc tool.

  * #9,#10 Improve design.

    Restructured using ldap_server, ldap_connection, ldap_request, ldap_reply
    structs, copying the design of https://github.com/taf2/libebb.

  * Extend Search support.

    Extended search support enough to support libnss-ldap clients, exporting the
    local nsswitch view of passwd/group/etc.

    #3 Add support for typesOnly and attribute selection.

  * #2 Optimize Search.

    Added Filter_scope() analysis to figure out what the search is constrained
    to instead of scanning everything.

  * #4 Add StartTLS support.

    StartTLS support with security checking before allowing bind implemented
    using mbedtls.

  * #13 Make served users/groups configurable.

    Support serving only some user/group ranges using `-U` and `-G` arguments to
    specify uid/gid ranges to export.

entente (1.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Improve options.

    Make -b basedn argument work. Make -l loopback argument work. Simplified and
    removed environment based settings.

  * Make pam authentication failures non-blocking:

    It will nolonger stall all connections ~2 seconds whenever someone tries a
    bad user/passwd. Instead only the connection that failed to bind is paused
    for time configured by pam_fail_delay.

  * Improved bind result failure returncodes.

    Changed the bind failure response resultcode from "other" to
    "invalidDNSyntax" or "invalidCredentials", depending on why it failed.

  * Tidy code.

    Reformated using "indent -linux -l120". Added a "tidy" make target to do
    this automatically.

    Tidied up lots of code, simplifying methods, renaming things to be more
    consistant, and make better use of common library functions.

    Made all memory allocation checking to use "alloc or die" macro's, since
    libev will abort on alloc failures anyway.

  * Improved/updated debian build:

    Updated for debhelper v9. Added debclean make target.
